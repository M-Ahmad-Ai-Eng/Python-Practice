A compact, practical path to build strong Python fundamentals with hands-on exercises and daily practice.



## About

This repository contains daily Python practice exercises and small projects designed to help you progress from beginner to confident Python developer in 20 focused days. Each day contains short, practical exercises and example code you can run and adapt.



## ✨ Highlights

- Structured, day-by-day learning path
- Short exercises you can finish in one session
- Ready-to-run examples and notes
- Clear progression from basics to intermediate topics




## Get Started

Prerequisites:
- Git
- Python 3.8+ (3.10+ recommended)
- (Optional) VS Code or your preferred editor

Quick setup:
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/M-Ahmad-Ai-Eng/Python-Practice.git
cd Python-Practice

# create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install dependencies if any
pip install -r requirements.txt || echo "No requirements file found"
```

If you use the `uv` tool:
```bash
# sync using uv (if you have it)
uv sync
```
If `uv` isn't installed, open the `day_43` folder and follow the setup instructions there.



## Quick run example

To run a sample exercise (adjust the path to the relevant day file):
```bash
python day_01/example.py
```
Each day folder includes a README or example file showing how to run the code.
